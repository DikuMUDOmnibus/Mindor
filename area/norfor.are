Outside Northern Gate~
The sky is cluttered with dense vegatation from the forest.  The walls of
the city are kept clean and free of any vegatation grown up or around them. 
The path is a plain path with a lot of prints in it from the passerbys. 
There is a variety of flowers planted along the path.  The path leads north
into the Nornir forest and south back into Nornir.

Path in the forest~
Entrance to the Nornir forest.  The trees are are some of the largest on
the continent.  They extend all the way to the skyline, blocking the view of
the sky.  Around the path the trees and shurbs are neatly cleaned.  The path
is a plain dirt trail with small vegitation growing nearby.

Path in the forest~
The path through the dense forest is not well explored by most travelers.
There are alot of exotic plants and animals through out this region of the
forest.  The sky is very cluttered from all the high dense growth the
trees.  Can barely make out if it is day or nite.  There are not many
footprints in the dirt of the path.  The thick shurbs on the sides of the
path make is impossible to wonder from it.

Up a ladder~
The tree house landing is a couple more steps up.  The ground is starting to
look very far down now.  The limbs from neighboring trees are making it
difficult to climb up.  The planks of the ladder seem to be sturdy enough
to continue climbing towards the platform of the treehouse.  Upon further
inspection of the tree,  someone has left thier hammer in the side of the 
tree.

Norsek River~
The continents main source of water, Norsek river is one of the largest
in the continent to be explored.  Many types of fish and plant life depend
on this river to bring in food.  Many of the trees grow right up to the edge
of the river front.  The water look as clear as an ocean.  The sky is partly
visibly from this point.

Path in the forest~
Entrance to another part of the Nornir forest.  This part seems little
bit more different then the previoius.  The trees seem to be listening to
everthing that is done.  The big redwoods of the forest tower clear up to
the sky and make it so dark not even the light of day can penetrate through.
It is almost impossible to see beyond the trees due to a heavy mist that
seems to linger about.  There is the sound of running water back to the
west.

nieghboring trees.  The shrubs almost seem to reach out and try and touch
the wandering travelers.

Path in the forest~
A path in another part of the Nornir forest.  This part is little bit
more different then the previoius.  The trees are listening to everthing
that is done and said.  The big redwoods of the forest tower all the up to
the sky and make it so dark not even the light of day can't penetrate
through.  It is almost impossible to see beyond the trees due to a heavy
mist that is lingering about.  The path is cluttered with leaves from the
nieghboring trees.  The shrubs reach out so far as if to try and touch the
wandering travelers.  The sound from the water fall can be heard to the
west.  There is a small path east of here.

The river bank has been washed out to a point that it is safe enought to
transverse up the side of the bank to the path leading east.  There is a
large tower to the east and the river is back west.
